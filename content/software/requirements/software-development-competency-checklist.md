These is a short and non-descriptive post. It's more like a checklist for teams
to look at to quickly measure themselves or find areas that could be
improved. There are many more things that need to be considered to be able to
produce quality code, but these are the fundamentals.

I've learned some these the hard-way and I think that teams that don't have
**all** of these are not producing top-quality code. The specifics on *how* they
implement some of them (e.g. code reviews or knowledge sharing) may vary, but
they must be there.

## Must-have's

Do you:

- have a proactive team?
- have an acceptance person?
- have a primary communication channel?
- have a person that advocates rules?
- have a short iterational process?
- have daily status meetings?
- have continuous integration?
- have one-step deployment?
- have a task and bug management system?
- have unit tests with growing coverage?
- have end-to-end tests for your DSL?
- have a shared library?
- do code reviews?

## Nice-to-have's

Do you:

- contribute to open source?
- share your expertise with your peers?
- share your expertise with the world?
