> A child does not discover the world by learning abstract rules. Instead it
> learns by looking at concrete examples. An example contains the rules as
> well. In contrast to rules, the recognition of examples can be based on
> tangible reality. The knowledge extracted from an example serves as a pattern
> that is used to remember facts and to construct new solutions. When grownups
> are about to learn something or have to apply unknown tools, they are put into
> a child’s position again. They will favor concrete examples over abstract
> rules. The rules will happily be generated automatically, for this is how the
> brain works.
