> We have developed speed but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives
> abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical, our
> cleverness hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than
> machinery we need humanity; more than cleverness we need kindness and
> gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be
> lost.
