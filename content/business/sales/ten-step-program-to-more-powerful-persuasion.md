Alan’s Ten Step Program to More Powerful Persuasion
Build your vocabulary daily
Write down and look up words you don’t know
Strive for “mid-high” level speech
Create and practice metaphors, analogies, and examples
Use repeatedly until natural
Keep examples contemporary through reading
Understand the other person’s behavioral comfort zone
Flexibly change your own behavioral set
Use emotion, not logic, to spur to action
Listen 80% of the time
Employ effective listening techniques
Allow silences and don’t seek to fill them
Visualize and anticipate
Consider the conversational options in advance
Create an articulate response to every likely objection
Focus on output, not input
Transfer your mental set to result and outcome
Distinguish between them with the other party
Avoid defensiveness
Use judo and momentum to reverse direction
Ask “why”
Provide options, not a fait accompli
Move the discussion from “if” to “how”
Engage the other in the diagnosis
Move through a series of small “yeses”
Know your business model
Gain conceptual agreement methodically
Always concentrate on value, never price, cost, or fee
Never voluntarily discuss fees
Defray questions about fee in the other’s best interests
