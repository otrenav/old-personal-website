Qualifying System
It’s important to be able to quickly qualify prospects and leads so
that we can apply scarce resources and time to the highest potential opportunities.
Therefore, you need to create some qualifying criteria.

On the next page is a model I’ve developed. Substitute your own criteria
and ratings as appropriate. I’ve filled in the content to illustrate the
usage. It’s a great idea to run every prospective client through this
quickly. (Just because you only have a few leads doesn’t mean you should
pursue them if they’re not potentially valuable. You’d be better off spending
the time on further marketing.)

Instructions:

List your ideal traits for a potential client.
Rate those traits based on 10 as highest and 1 as lowest. You may
have more than one 10 or any other number.
Fill in the actual traits that your prospect possesses.
Score your prospect’s actual traits against each ideal, with a 10
being a perfect fit, and a 0 being a total mismatch.
Multiply the rating times the score in each category.
Add up the rated scores to get a total.
Compare the total against the ideal total (all 10s in scoring) and
come up with a percentage of the idea.
Decide which percentage minimum is required for follow-up and with
what priority and apply. I recommend nothing below 80%.
Note: If you don’t have enough information to complete the form, then do some further homework. It will be worth it.

In my example, the maximum R/S possible (all scores of 10 in every category) would be 420. The actual candidate scored 338, which is 80%, or a low “B.”
