Alan’s Guide to Powerful Teleconferencing

Audience

Need a high quality list or network who knows you and your brand.
Must focus on need and pragmatics.
Don’t expect web site or passive advertising to create critical mass.
Offer for free if you must build interest.
Shortcut: Link or ally with someone already owning audience.

Technology

Use a reputable bridge line provider.
Make sure you record it and can secure MP3 downloads.
Use a landline phone without headset for your delivery.
Make sure you have capacity to mute entire group.

Preparation

Use bullet points so that you are conversational, not scripted.
Ignore errors. I fell of my chair twice within one minute during a broadcast.
Always try to include Q&A if appropriate.
Practice for length and comfort.
Have extra material in case you run short.
Know in advance what to cut in case you run long.
Have a comfortable, private place to do it.

Logistics

Remind everyone of protocols 24-48 hours prior, because they get lost.
Have an emergency number in case lines are not functioning.
Secure the appropriate size bridge line.
Allow people to gather about 5 minutes prior, but end and hang up on time.
If you have an interview, include that person on the moderator line.
Arrange with your own audio person to download and make into product.

Content

Use humor in the form of stories; only ad lib if you’re a genius. (You’re not.)
Have a discernable beginning, middle, and ending.
Be provocative.
Use inflection, volume, power language, and tone variations.
Anywhere from 45-60 minutes is fine.
Be careful about references that will date the recording if you intend to use one.
Build your brand and your expertise.
Bear in mind product attraction (e.g., numbered lists).

Marketing

Use as CD, in albums, and/or MP3s.
Sell on web site, to trade associations, etc.
Send people to your web site, blog, etc., with offers of value.
Use prior ones to sell future ones.
Put excerpts on your home page as streaming audio.
Send out physical materials before or after electronically.
Copyright the CD or any physical creation.
Pricing depends on brand, content, length, etc.
Low end pricing, $25; high end pricing $100+.
You can sell a “line” to a company, not just to individuals.

Other Stuff

They need to be consistent and continual, at varying delivery times.
Vary them with interviews, Q&A, case studies, etc.
Respect your audience and make them stretch; don’t pander.
Remember YOUR purpose; 5,000 non-buying listeners are ego-only.
Be careful to whom you listen for advice.
