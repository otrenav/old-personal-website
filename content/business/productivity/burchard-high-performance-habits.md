## Personal habits

### 1. Seek clarity

> "Motivation is what gets you started. Habit is what keeps you going."
>
> -Jim Rohn

Practices:

- Envision the future
- Determine the feeling you're after
- Define what's meaningful

Have vision and consistently set clear intentions for who you want to be each
day, how you want to interact with others, what skills you must develop to win
in the future, and how you can make a difference and serve with excellence.
Never enter a situation without thinking through the 4 S's: self, social, skill,
and service.

Ask yourself frequently, "What is the primary feeling I want to bring to this
situation?" Don't wait for emotions to land on you; choose and cultivate the
feelings that you wish to consistently experience and share in life.

### 2. Generate energy

Practices:

- Release tension, set intention
- Bring the joy
- Optimize health

Use tansitions between activities to renew your energy. Do this by closing your
eyes, practicing deep breathing, and releasing tension in your body and thoughts
in your mind. Try to do this at least once every hour. Once you feel tension
lift, set a clear intention for your next activity, open your eyes, and get to work
with vibrant focus.

Be responsible for the energy you bring to your day and each situation in life.
Focus especially on bringing joy to your activities. Anticipate positive
emotions, set triggers to remind you to be positive and grateful, and appreciate
the small things and the people around you.

If the demands of your life require you to learn quickly, deal with stress, be
alert, pay attention, remember important things, and keep a positive mood, then
you must take sleep, exercise, and nutrition more seriously. You already know
things you should be doing. Do them!

### 3. Raise the necessity

> "It's about rising to serve a misssion, not the mission bowing down to match
> my limited strengths."
>
> -Brendon Burchard

> "When you have the opportunity to serve, you don't complain about the effort
> involved."
>
> -Brendon Burchard

Practices:

- Know who needs your A game
- Affirm your why
- Level up your squad

You cannot become extraordinary wihtout a sense that it's absolutely necessary
to excel, for yourself and for others. From now on, whenever you sit down at
your desk, ask: "Who needs me on my A game the most right now?" What about my
identity and external obligations make it imperative for me to deliver today?"

When you verbalize something, it becomes more real and important to you. Speak
your "why" to yourself out loud often, and share it with others. This will
motivate you to live in congruence with your commitments. So the next time you
want to increase your peformance necessity, declare -to yourself and others-
what you want and why you want it.

Emotions and excellence are contagious, so spend more time with the most
positive and successful people in your peer group. Then continue building your
ideal network of supportive and empowering people. Ask, "How can I work with the
best people as I embark on this next project? How can I inspire others to raise
their standards?"

## Social habits

### 4. Increase productivity

Practices:

- Increase the outputs that matter
- Plan your next five moves
- Get insanely good at key skills

Determine the outputs that matter in determining your success, differentiation,
and contribution to your field or industry. Focus there, say no to almost
everything else, and be prolific in creating those outputs with high standards
of quality. Remember that the main thing is to keep the main thing the main
thing.

Ask, "If there were only five major moves to make the goal happen, what would
they be?" Thank of each major move as a big bucket of activities, a project.
Break the projects down into deliverables, deadlines, and activities. Once
you're clear on these things, put them into your calendar, and schedule the bulk
of your time working on them.

Determine the five major skills you need to develop over the next three years to
grow into the person you hope to become. Then set out to develop those skills
with obsessive focus through the steps of progressive mastery. The most
important thing is to always be developing the critical skills to your future
success.

Progressive mastery:

1. Determine a skill you want to learn
2. Attach a high emotional meaning
3. Set specific goals and deadlines
4. Identify critical factors and know how you compare
5. Learn and practice, continously and frequently
6. Measure progress
7. Get outside feedback
8. Socialize learning
   - Teach others (e.g. blog, videos)
   - Participate in competitions
9. Repeat

### 5. Develop influence

> "A teacher affects eternity."
>
> -Henry Adams

Practices:

- Teach people how to think
- Challenge people to grow
- Role model the way

In every situation of influence, prepare by asking yourself how do you want
other people to think about themselves, other people, and the world at large.
Then go communicate that consistently. Shape people's thinking by saying things
like: "Think of it this way...", "What do you think about...", "What would
happen if we tried..."

Observe people's character, connections, and contributions, and actively
challenge them to develop those things even further. Ask people if they gave
their all, if they could be treating those around them better, and if they could
give even more or serve with even greater excellence and distinction.

Seventy-one percent of high performers say they think about being a role model
daily. They want to be a good role model for their family, the team, and the
greater community. So ask, "How can I handle this situation in a way that will
inspire others to believe in themselves, be their best, and serve others with
integrity, heart, and excellence?"

### 6. Demonstrate courage

Practices:

- Honor the struggle
- Share your truth and ambitions
- Find someone to fight for

When you have the opportunity to learn and serve, you don't complain about the
effort involved. View struggle as necessary, important, and a positive part of
the journey so that you can find true peace and personal power. Don't bemoan the
inevitable hardships of self-improvement and chasing your dreams; have reverence
for challenge.

The main motivation of humankind is to be free, to express our true selves and
pursue our dreams without restriction --to experience what may be called
personal freedom. Follow this impulse by consistently sharing your true
thoughts, feelings, needs, and dreams with other people. Do not play small to
placate others. Live your truth.

We need a noble cause to rise for. High performers tend to make that cause just
one person --they want to fight for that person so they can be safe, imprve, or
live better quality of life. You will do more for others than for yourself. And
in doing something for others, you will find your reason for courage, and your
cause for focus and excellence.
