Kickoff Kit: Tools to Help Teams Work Better Together

How do you work?
In order to build products successfully and quickly, your team has to work well together. But so often teams dive into projects without recognizing how each member best operates or what everyone is working towards.

My colleague Rosy Catanach and I have started lots of projects with various teams, and we have seen what happens both when these steps are addressed (productive, positive progress) and when they’re skipped (confusing, frustrating, slow process). Rosy is currently an Executive Director of product and I am a product director here at The New York Times.

We pulled together a collection of exercises that we’ve found to be helpful in aligning a team in order to move forward quickly and productively. Last June at SRCCON, we presented the exercises in a session we called Kickoff Kit. The idea is that as a team “kicks off,” either with new members or with a new project, they can avoid bigger disasters in the product development process later by using this kit of exercises.

Misalignment Happens
Misalignment is completely natural at the beginning, especially when working with cross-functional teams made up of people from different disciplines. Here at The Times, we’ve found that not only do we need to account for the difference in style between engineers and designers, but also with journalists. The newsroom has long-held traditions and ways of working, some of which run counter to an agile development process. Cross-functional teams — with journalists and editors — make excellent products, they just have to take the time to make sure they’re setup for success and are working toward the same goals.

Exercises
The exercises we pulled together come from lots of different sources. Some focus more on work habits and preferences, while others are geared more towards a shared understanding of the product’s goals and trajectory. All of them can be found in this .pdf and I’ve highlighted three of them below: Muppet Analysis; How We Work Best; and Hopes, Fears, and Non-negotiables.

1. Muppet Analysis
Why it’s important
Building heavily on Slate’s Chaos Theory of Muppets, the theory goes you are either an order or a chaos muppet. Neither is good or bad, and a well performing team has a good balance of order and chaos muppets. This exercise will help each team member identify their own muppet style and better understand how they can work together as a team.

Instructions
Have each member of the team take the quiz (see below) to identify themselves as order or chaos. On the worksheet, choose A or B for each statement. If you are in between, choose the one that you tend to do more — this is intentionally binary! Tally how many As and Bs you get.


Muppet Analysis Quiz
Answer Key
7 or More A’s — Mostly an Order Muppet
6 A’s — Centrist Order Muppet
6 B’s — Centrist Chaos Muppet
7 or More B’s — Mostly a Chaos Muppet

Takeaways and Follow-ups
Go around the room and have everyone share their results. Talk through how the makeup of the team could impact the work ahead.

Different team makeups will have different benefits and concerns:


Muppet Analysis Takeaways
Example
This exercise is particularly helpful when a team is going into a Discovery phase of a project, when there are lots of unknowns and the future can be ambiguous. Acknowledging everyone’s level of comfort with ambiguity may not make the process easier, but at least the team can develop empathy for how some members might be feeling.

2. How We Work Best
Why it’s important
How do you work? How do other team members work? Use this worksheet to identify characteristics of your team and help create team norms.

Instructions
Have worksheets (see below) and Sharpies ready for the team. Give the team five to 10 minutes to mark where each of them falls on the spectrums. For example, if you are definitely a morning person, draw an X on the far left side of the first spectrum.

Takeaways and Follow-ups
After everyone is finished, go around and have each team member share their results. Talk about what team norms you can identify based on these preferences.

Create a master set of the spectra on an easel pad or large piece of paper. Have each team member write their initials on seven Post-its or stickers and place them on the master set. Displaying the results altogether will help identify balances and imbalances.

Example
One of the most common differences this exercise helps to surface is the way newsroom staff are often trained to have everything perfect before “hitting publish.” Interaction designers, on the other hand, tend to prefer getting an MVP out to users quickly, knowing things aren’t perfect, in order to get feedback. Having a conversation about this tension early in the process can go a long way in mapping out a team’s roadmap and setting expectations.

3. Hopes, Fears, and Non-negotiables
Why it’s important
Secrets grow in darkness. Bring to light your team’s hopes, fears and things they’re not willing to give up so that issues don’t appear when it’s too late. Use this exercise to build trust among your team members as they better understand where each other is coming from.

Instructions
Have Post-its (ideally in three colors, one for each category) and Sharpies ready for the team. Spend three to five minutes on each category:


Hopes, Fears, Non-negotiables Exercise
Have everyone put all of their hopes in one pile, fears in a second pile, and non-negotiables in a third.

Takeaways and Follow-ups
Start with one category. Go around the room and have each person take a Post-it and read it. It doesn’t have to be theirs — anonymizing the ideas can help alleviate awkwardness and have the team share in honoring each one. Document the results, especially the Non-Negotiables, so that they can be referred back to later as needed.

Example
A common “non-negotiables” we hear is that the product or feature needs to be “Timesian.” That is, whatever we build must comply to the editorial and journalistic standards of The New York Times. Surfacing the concern helps the team not only acknowledge the standard, but also arrive at a shared definition of Timesian-ness. What are the qualities that we need to protect? What are the boundaries we could try to push on?

Tips
If this kind of work feels completely weird and foreign, that’s okay! Go for it. And here are a few tips we can offer as you start out:

Don’t use all the exercises at once. Maybe start with one to get the ball rolling, but pay attention to team dynamics and understand what’s needed. Some exercises might make sense for your team at the beginning, while others might be more effective later in the process. When in doubt, have a conversation and see what the team thinks.

Don’t get lost in process. Talking about doing the thing is not the same as doing the thing — you still have to do the thing. These exercises can — and should! — be fun, but they’re not a substitute for building products.

Do be honest, empathetic and grounded when running these exercises. Big emotions can come up and you need to make sure team members feel safe to express them. Remember that feelings are neither right or wrong. Lead by example.
