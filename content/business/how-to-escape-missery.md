How to Escape Misery
Today: How to escape misery. That’s right. I’m going to help you very quickly, very rapidly
escape misery. So listen, if one or more of these apply to you, here’s how you escape.
Number 1, stop internalizing and personalizing everybody else’s problems. There’s a word for
that and it’s call neuroses. Other people have problems and they are responsible for solving
them. Believing that you are somehow the one who has to take on the burden is ridiculous. Let
them have the responsibility. By all means, support them. But don’t think it’s your internal
problem or challenge to do so.
Next, forgive yourself. That’s right, you deserve to be happy. Start giving yourself a break.
You forgive others, right? Why not forgive yourself. The person we least forgive is the person
in the mirror. So stop suffering, stop holding long and deep grudges, stop treating yourself like
you ought to be beaten down. You’re not unworthy. So stop telling yourself you are.
Next, stop isolating yourself. Don’t avoid contact. You need a support system. It might be
loved ones. It might be family. It might be friends. It might be colleagues. It might be people
at work or people at clients or people in trade associations or people in the community or people
at the coffee shop. Don’t allow yourself to be isolated. Don’t reject help that’s offered. I’m not
talking about unsolicited feedback. I am talking about honest to goodness offers of support.
Next, stop trying to please everybody. We spend a whole lot of time trying to make sure
everybody else is pleased with us. Don’t compromise your standards. It’s okay if some people
are pissed off. “What did he say?” Yes, I said it. It’s all right. Your personal value doesn’t
depend on acceptance of others. Your personal value depends upon self-mastery. That is, how
do you feel about yourself.
Next, stop comparing yourself with others. You’re your own person. So speaking of selfmastery,
be ipsative not normative. In other words, who are you according to you. Stop looking
at others as your standard. Stop looking at others as the person who is your avatar. A lot of
those people have feet of clay. A lot of those people are before congressional hearings right now
or they’re indicted for fraud. Please stop worrying about it and just be yourself.
Next, live for the moment. Don’t look back in nostalgia and don’t look forward in anticipation,
look around and enjoy yourself. Today is today; it won’t come again. Nor will this minute. And
so, enjoy yourself in the moment. That’s what self-actualization is all about. Don’t be afraid to
relish where you are right now. Don’t feel guilty about that. Enjoy yourself. Connected with
that, don’t dwell on past mistakes and failures. I’ve got news for you, you can’t undo them. In
fact, the best thing you can do is learn from them. But then, move on. Stop focussing on things
you can no longer change. It’s astounding how many people spend time focussed on things they
have no power in the world to change. Making yourself miserable doesn’t help others you’ve
made miserable in the past, trust me.
Next, try to stay positive and oriented towards solutions and new levels of performance. Don’t be
negative. Don’t always look at problems. I talk to people who sigh after every other sentence.
That’s right, “{sigh} well I guess I’ll get more money today.” Oh that’s too bad, sorry to hear it.
For goodness sakes, remain positive. Self-talk is real talk. Talk to yourself positively and look
at your surroundings positively. Believe me, it could be worse.
Next, don’t allow yourself to be controlled by others or by circumstances. We’ve touched on
this a little to this point. But it’s too easy in a world that is trying every day to make you into
something else to fall victim to that. So don’t allow yourself to be controlled. Don’t worry
about what the advertisements say you should be wearing. Don’t worry about what unsolicited
feedback tells you about your behavior or your speaking or your interactions. Don’t allow
yourself to be controlled by others unless you respect their opinion and unless you solicit it.
Next, take on involvement and responsibility. People who take on accountabilities are better off.
The best people I meet on committees, on boards, on task forces are those who stand out in a
crowd and chair something, or head something, or take a risk. Try things new. You’ll be
successful. You’ll get increased satisfaction. But don’t sit around avoiding involvement,
avoiding responsibility. The world is not like that. Step out in the crowd. Get into the limelight.
Two more. First, set realistic expectations for yourself. If you want to lose weight, if you want
to get in shape, fine. But telling yourself to lose 35 pounds in 2 months is ridiculous. On the
other hand, signing up for a gym and promising to go 3 times a week is probably pretty
achievable. Don’t set unrealistic goals. Don’t tell yourself you’re going to make a million
dollars 1 year from now. If you do, great! Listen, I’m not against having all the confidence in
the world. But it’s much better to say, “someday, in the meanwhile, I’m going to double my
present income from $200,000 to $400,000.” So don’t set unrealistic expectations. Set
expectations and achievements that you’re likely to hit.
Finally, base your worth on things that you believe in. Don’t base your worth on externals. Not
external feedback. Not the way you look. No what you do. That is not your job title. Not the
possessions you have. Love yourself unconditionally. Don’t base your worth on things to be
pointed to. Now that comes from someone who wrote Million Dollar Consulting, and I am well
aware of that. But I also know who I am. You have to know you’re a good person. You have to
believe that you’re a good person. And if you do, the world will look a lot better because you’re
a good person.
