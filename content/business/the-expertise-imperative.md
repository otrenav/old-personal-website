What This Project is About
In March 2000,the National Speakers Association Board of Directors made an alteration
to the organization’s mission statement.NSA would henceforth become “the
leading association of experts who speak.”While little was said about the revision
at the time,the speaking profession was about to enter one of the most turbulent
periods of contraction and uncertainty since NSA’s founding in 1973.
In late 2002, NSA President-elect Mark Sanborn, CSP, CPAE, invited a committee of
members to take on the task of discussing the implications of the changing marketplace.“Critical
to the long-term success of NSA, its brand and the speaking profession
will be the emphasis of ‘expertise.’To overcome the stigma of being an
association of speakers who give ‘three points and a poem,’NSA has committed to
targeting and serving ‘experts who speak professionally.’”
“It won’t be enough to be a good speaker,” Sanborn concluded.“Being able to
develop, demonstrate and enhance expertise and then communicate it effectively
and powerfully will be key.” Sanborn charged the group to assist the membership
and “bring definition and framework to expertise: what it is, how to develop and
enhance it, how to demonstrate it and other important nuances of the topic.”
A few weeks into the project,those of us on the committee realized we had been
asked to do the nearly impossible by delineating what constitutes marketable
expertise.Hundreds of e-mails, dozens of opinions, viewpoints, rebuttals and a
thousand combined person-hours later,this paper is a result of our discussion,
debate, research and thought.
In this paper, we seek to understand expertise in both a general sense and as it is
understood and ascertained in other professions.We discuss how the demand for
a unique form of expertise relates to the business of speaking and examine how a
changing marketplace portends that expertise, crafted uniquely and delivered eloquently
and effectively, can become a competitive advantage for our members.
Finally, we invite you, as a fellow professional speaker,to consider how our insights
into this subject might improve your own effectiveness and raise the perception of
professional speaking in the meetings industry.
Why Expertise is the New Imperative
In an era of uncertainty, we are certain of one thing:the fundamental value of
employing paid professional speakers is being re-examined like never before. We have
arrived at what Intel Chairman Andrew Grove calls a “strategic inflection point.”In
his book,Only the Paranoid Survive, Grove describes “a time in the life of a business
[or industry] when its fundamentals are about to [or have already] changed… that
change can mean an opportunity to rise to new heights. But it may just as likely
signal the beginning of the end.”
We believe that today’s challenging marketplace does not signal the beginning of
the end of our profession, but that today’s adversity can become our opportunity
to rise to new heights.
In the foreseeable future, clients who hire speakers will negotiate harder, press for
fee concessions and other give-backs, and at the same time demand, extensive

preparation, customization and sharply-focused understanding of audience needs.
Most damaging for long-term growth prospects is their perception that hiring professional
speakers is not essential to ensuring successful meetings. The phrase,“we are
using industry experts”has become all too familiar. Professional speakers face
expert competitors.Not only is the niche expert priced at a lower fee, but he or she
is all too willing to lower fees or work for free just for the “exposure”or to gain
clients for a separate business,such as consulting.
The appeal of these presenters is not only their willingness to work for less money.
More importantly, it’s their expertise.Typically,they know more about the specific
industry,field, category, client or profession than the professional speaker.Their credibility
is almost always based on experience.Their knowledge is current and often
supported with proprietary research.The audience often knows them by reputation.
Client audiences have a tremendous need to hear from experts as the pace of
regulatory,social, lifestyle and technological change continues to explode.
Conventions and conferences are now looked at not as a perk for a job well done,
but as an investment.Any expenditure of time, money and talent will continue to
warrant a measurable return on investment.
Preparing for Tomorrow
In this new environment, we believe value will be the overriding factor in the
choice of whether to hire outside professional speakers and on which speakers are
chosen.The ability to demonstrate and make tangible the value of our unique
expertise will be essential to the prosperity of our profession and may well be
required for its survival.
What this market also portends is that as a brand,we are in thistogether.Professional
Speaker X who fails to deliver the goods makes it less likely that next time the same
decision-maker will shell out big bucks to put Professional Speaker Y on the platform.
Although there will always be a place for presentations that are solely entertaining,
humorous or emotionally compelling, it will no longer be enough for content speakers
to impart a few easily remembered points of wisdom and pick up a paycheck.
Does this mean that the speaker with accomplished platform skills, but with a subject
expertise that is shallow and based upon “reading a few articles and putting
together a talk,”will not be viable in the marketplace of the future?
Our conclusion is that this reality is already upon us.
What Expertise Is and Why It Matters
On the surface,there is nothing complicated about expertise.Webster’s New World
Dictionary wastes no words in defining it as“the skill, knowledge, and judgment of an
expert.”And what is an expert? “A person who is very skillful or highly trained and
informed in some special field.”Various academic researchers have denoted two,
three or more types of expertise and all agree that expertise is beyond competence.
Competence is the possession of required skills,strengths,traits,behaviors and abilities
that enable an individual to perform sufficiently to complete a job or assignment.
A White Paper from the National Speaker s As sociation 4
Early researchers distinguished between content/knowledge and process/performance.
For professional speakers,the most relevant research on measuring expertise
may come from studies of teachers. Researchers who focus on teaching added
a third type of expertise: pedagogical. Pedagogical experts are superior instructors.
Their students learn more than students of novices.
It may be useful to think about whether speaking expertise in some fields can be
measured by the results obtained by audience members. Might expert sales trainers,
for example, be measured by the increase in sales after their presentations?
Granted,there may be several factors that affect sales. For instance,the
“Hawthorne Effect”indicates improved performance simply because sales people
are being acknowledged.Nonetheless,the fact that a trainer’s effectiveness may
be difficult to measure does not mean it shouldn’t be measured. Moreover, assuming
all other factors are equal, we could at least say that particular sales trainers are
not experts if, over time,sales consistently go down after they speak.
Deepening Your Expertise for a Changing Market
If the “expert who speaks professionally”is the success model of our future,then
how does one go about developing expertise—or furthering it? Researchers
acknowledge there is a continuum of expertise with five levels: novice, advanced
beginner, competent, proficient and expert.
How do people develop from novice to expert? Initially, researchers had thought
that expertise is developed through education,training, research, attainment of
credentials or years of experience.Teachers who are considered experts attended
continuing education courses in the field, kept up on the literature and research,
knew the large controversies and debates that were underway in the field, reflected
on their practice, and adapted their work to changes in the field.
Although all of these may be important, only some are necessary for expertise, and
none of them are sufficient. More recently, researchers have thought that expertise
is developed through“deliberate practice.”Deliberate practice is something that
cannot be done while working or performing. It has four elements: the practice
focuses on a well-defined task; the task is at an appropriate level of difficulty; the
person receives informative feedback; and the person has opportunities for repetition
and correction of errors.
1
Informative feedback can come from the environment; for example, a tennis player
practicing serves can see if the ball is in or out. But for more complex tasks, a coach
or teacher provides feedback.How long must one practice? The “10-year rule”says
that anyone seeking to perform at world-class level in any significant field must
engage in sustained, deliberate practice in the activity for at least 10 years.

Measuring the Expertise of the Professional Speaker
After our foray into the literature and research on expertise, we began to see
which dimensions or manifestations of expertise made sense in our field and
which did not.Our Task Force agreed that the following metrics can serve as
guidelines for identifying expertise and goals for enhancing our expert standing.
This list is not meant to be exhaustive but presented as a guideline.What follows is
a list of dimensions of expertise and criteria that measure the attainment of each
dimension.We propose that an individual’s expertise be established by an attainment
of preponderance (75 percent of the overall criteria and at least 60 percent
in any single dimension) in each “expertise dimension.”

Recommendations
Should standards for expertise be formalized in an Association that considers itself
“the leading organization for experts who speak professionally?”We deliberated
this question and decided, for now at least,that this would not be the best course.
Members of our Association must evaluate their own levels of expertise.The association
has a responsibility for providing education that can stimulate attainment,
accelerate enhancement and leverage the value of that expertise. And of course,
the best metric will continue to be the marketplace that we serve. Beyond this, we
believe that as an NSA member you should:
• Evaluate yourself in comparison to the metrics above. Can you confidently
state that you are an expert as you compare your practice against the criteria?
If you fall behind in a certain dimension, does that point to an opportunity
area for improvement?
• Emphasize and demonstrate expertise in your communication with clients.
Shift away from pointing out only the entertaining or platform-oriented
aspects of your work and highlight the value that stems from your expertise.
• Maintain a Web site that is state-of-the-art and highly respected in your field.
• Actively search for interview opportunities in the major media that demonstrate
your expertise.
• Seek out testimonials from clients that emphasize the value of the expertise
you deliver from the platform.
• Deepen your understanding of your field. Fill in gaps in your understanding of
the historical and research roots of your topics.Take courses, matriculated or
non-matriculated, in your subject area every year.
• Subscribe to and read all the pertinent journals and newsletters in your
field of expertise.
• Read six books in your subject field each year.
• Write at least one book in your area of expertise.
• Serve as a mentor in your field.
• Take leadership positions in applicable trade and professional associations.
• Teach at a community college, university,trade school or adult education program
where you share your depth of expertise in the field.
• Seek out opportunities where you can engage in dialogue regarding your area
of expertise. Participate in forums,symposia, debates, discussions (both live
and electronic), mastermind groups and colloquies in your area of expertise.
• Evolve and change your presentations every year to reflect new thinking and
deeper understanding of your subject.
A White Paper from the National Speaker s As sociation 9
• Work to improve continuously by seeking out opportunities for deliberate
practice. Critically review video and audio of yourself, work with coaches,take
classes and belong to a peer advisory group that will aid you in development
and improvement.
• Enhance your reputation in your area of expertise by the challenging practice
of contributing original thought to the field. Become known for developing
new models, approaches and techniques in your subject areas. Achieve the
reputation of a valued innovator and deep thinker.
• Always take questions in your presentations, even keynotes.
Conclusion
In an era of uncertainty in the meetings industry,the fundamental value of
employing paid professional speakers is being re-examined like never before.We
conclude this process more firmly convinced than ever that expertise is important
now and will continue to rise in importance for success in this profession. Expertise
is the critical component of the value proposition that the professional speaker brings
to the platform. We have attempted to raise awareness of expertise, expose you to
research in the field, and promote subject matter mastery in the speaking profession
with this white paper.We offer these suggestions for your review and scrutiny.
Our belief is that we all need to improve our effectiveness and raise the reputation
of our brand with organizations and individuals increasingly oriented toward pragmatic
results.

Appendix A: Additional Research on Expertise
How Experts Think
A great deal of research has investigated how experts organize, retrieve, evaluate
and apply their knowledge. As compared to non-experts, experts have more
knowledge, organized in ways that make it accessible quickly.They are more
accurate and work with more ease.They recognize linkages within the knowledge
base, comprehend and accurately assess problems.They sort, identify and analyze
the essential contingencies with precision and proficiency.
3
As for problem solving,the expert spends proportionally more time building up a
basic representation of the problem before searching for a solution. Experts
demonstrate a wide repertoire of approaches to problems. Experts look for causes,
generate assumptions,select evaluation criteria, list relevant information, eliminate
irrelevant information and hypothesize descriptions. (Novices head straight for
solution of the problem.)
How Expertise is Measured and Validated
In some fields, expertise is validated by easily measurable results. For example,
expert chess players play faster and win more games than non-experts.The more
complex the area,the more difficult expertise is to measure. Following are some
measures that have been proposed by various researchers and the problems with
them:
• Social Acclamation–“Experts are people who other experts in the field say are
experts.”Besides being circular,the problem with this approach is that someone
who is at the cutting edge often is unpopular or rejected by peers.
• Internal Consistency–“Experts’ judgments should be internally consistent
across cases.”Although this may be a necessary measure, it is not sufficient, as
someone can be internally, consistently wrong.
• Consensus Reliability–“Experts are ‘right’ because they make the same judgments
as other experts.”This is circular argument to the extreme.
4
There is nothing wrong with using these as secondary characteristics of expertise;
they just don’t prove expertise.

A White Paper from the National Speaker s As sociation 11
How Teaching Expertise is Measured
One study we examined looked at students’scores on standardized tests. Another
used a metric called “SOLO,”in which students’written papers were reviewed on a
four-point scale for the depth of their understanding. 5
To be certified by the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards,teachers
are individually assessed by expert teachers in three ways:
1. They come to an assessment center for half a day and are given six topics to
“teach”to a teacher in their field of expertise.
2. They submit a portfolio for two teaching topics with lesson plans,teaching
resources,student exercises, learning assessments and student evaluations.
3. They provide two videotapes of 15 to 20 minutes, each demonstrating specified
skills in the classroom.
For all three of these assessments,there are voluminous and specific metrics that
must be met to prove content and pedagogical expertise. (The standards do not
attempt to assess performance expertise on the grounds that “there is no one
right way to teach.”) This program is fully detailed on the Board’s Web site.
6 It
should be noted that this program, and others like it around the world, is under
attack by teachers who believe that the most important factors in good teaching
are passion and enthusiasm.7

The Rewards of Expertise
Throughout this white paper we’ve emphasized the rational reasons to
develop, enhance and leverage expertise to improve a speaker’s business.
But being an expert is more than merely intellect, acquisition of knowledge,
measurement vs.standards and recognition of marketing advantages.
Expertise has other payoffs, as outlined in the following points from
our committee colleague, Alan Weiss, CMC, CSP.He proposes that expertise
is present and strong when an individual emotionally and psychologically:
1. Regularly and spontaneously creates projects,speeches and other
interventions that utilize various permutations and variations of the
expertise.
2. Demonstrates outright zeal and joy when engaged in the pursuit,
elevation and communication of the expertise.
3. Feels elated, rather than drained, after being challenged about the
subject matter.
4. Equates the expertise with the overused term,"authenticity."
That is,“this subject matter is me.”
5. Sparks others and subsequently triggers motivation through
sheer enthusiasm.
6. Rapidly develops and evolves the expertise; is motivated to create
sharp learning curves.
7. Is drawn "magnetically" to the subject area; making it hard to disengage
or omit it from thought.
8. Steadfastly believes and evangelically persuades that it is in the best
interests of others to share in the pursuit,skill or topic.
9. Feels frustration when the skill can't be applied or can’t be understood
by others.
10. "Retreats" to the expertise for solace,reinvigoration, comfort and
self-worth.
