Consulting Tips from The Million Dollar Consultant®
The key to maximizing income is to give things away. That’s not an oxymoron. Whenever you are communicating with a prospect—whether in person, by fax, by e-mail, by phone, by correspondence—provide something of value. (No, your brochure isn’t of value to the prospect!)

You can give away only one of two classes of value: tangibles, such as books, tapes, articles, documented models, etc., and intangibles, such as advice, referrals, feedback, empathic listening, etc. The idea is to have the prospect think, “If I received this much value in a casual contact, how much would I receive if I actually hired this person?”
The articles or advice don’t have to be yours. Simply providing something that the prospect can use, no matter what the source (and assuming you use proper attribution) creates value in the eyes of the client. When I learned that one prospect was a wine aficionado, I sent along a list of an expert’s choice of the best domestic wines. The value doesn’t have to be business-related, but it should stop short of gratuitous gift (i.e., bribery). If you’re seeing a prospect in person, either bring something along or provide it immediately after the meeting.

Prospects must see something of value beyond your charming personality. You can manage this aspect of the sales process, whether your consulting work is as a generalist, in computers, in outplacement, in sales, or anything else. Just ask yourself: “How will the prospect be better off having communicated with me?”

Short lesson: You’ve got to give to get.
If you want to maximize the size of initial contracts, be prepared to walk away from the business. Don’t walk into the initial meetings (prior to the proposal) with the fixation of “How will I get this business?” Instead, think about, “How will I get this business on my terms?”

When the buyer perceives us as a supplicant, “begging” for the business with our hat in our hand, he or she has the upper hand. In return for “granting” us the business, the prospect will be very demanding about fees, time frames, scope of the project and other variables. We’re inclined to give-in to successive demands as it appears we’re close to a sale. But, in reality, all we’re close to is a low- or no-margin project and a lousy relationship.

When the buyer insists early in the exploration, “What can you do for me?” respond with a simple “I don’t know.” Similarly, if the prospect demands, “What will this cost?” respond honestly “I don’t know.” Explain to the prospect that it’s prema-ture to determine what you can do or what investment is required before you’ve had the opportunity to find out a great deal more about the prospect’s condition. In this way you demonstrate several things simultaneously: first, that the relationship is collaborative, and not something you’re going to do to the client; second, that you’re not willing to be rushed or “cornered” before you can provide a reasoned assessment; and third, that this is a relationship between two peers, not a “buyer and vendor” dynamic.

When you appear ready to walk away from a possible sale, it says that you don’t want business at any cost, but only business on professional and peer-level terms. In the end, you’ll be able to charge much more for the projects you “accept” and you will walk away from those buyers who try to view you as an indentured servant.

Short lesson: You’re never a vendor, always a partner.
Shortcut of the month: If you’re on the phone and interrupted by call waiting, jot down the last sentence or thought of the current conversation before putting it on “hold.” When you return, immediately apologize for the interruption and cite your written note (i.e., “You were saying that domestic sales are lower than expected…”). This technique makes for a smooth transition back to your original call and removes the annoyance of having been put on “hold” for someone else.

Never allow the discussion with a prospect to focus on fees. Once that occurs, you are constantly on the defensive, trying to explain your contribution. Most embattled consultants resort to a description of the tasks they plan to perform, thereby aggravating the issue by allowing the prospect to zero-in on irrelevant matters such as how many days are to be spent on site, how much time is required to tabulate a survey, and how many people are necessary to do the job.

Always focus on value. Move the prospect’s attention to the outcomes of the engagement, and the impact of the results on the prospect’s business plans. This avoids the task and commodity concerns (how much time, how many people) and instead focuses on the results objectives, near and dear to the prospect’s heart.

If you’re faced with the question, “Can’t we do this for less?” reply simply, “Of course. Which value (results) would you like to eliminate? Should we focus only on the field and not the home office, or eliminate the plans to get customer responses, or forget about the coaching that was to follow the feedback?”

Prospects always want to reduce fees, but they never want to eliminate value. You control that dynamic by managing the conversation in a given direction. And it’s never the prospect’s business to help determine how many focus groups, how many interviews, how much training, how much observation or how much of anything else you do in the course of gathering information and formulating recommendations. That’s why you’re the consultant and the prospect has called you. Never surrender your expertise to a committee.

Short Lesson: Managing the project is easy compared to managing the conversations and expectations preceding it.
When you’re in competition with other firms, never feel constrained to remain within the client’s specifications for your presentations or proposals. Yes, that’s heresy. But it’s also smart marketing.

By all means meet every request in your prospect’s demands. But then exceed them. Provide options. Tell the prospect that you can conform to the specs if it’s mandatory, but you have an even better approach, and here’s what it looks like. Internal organizational specifications are often the poor result of diverse interests trying to satisfy conflicting objectives. They are not always sacrosanct, and are often ignored by the buyers themselves.

I lost a key contract once that I was sure I had the inside track on. When I inquired as to why another firm got it, I was told that our proposals had been quite similar, with mine slightly better. However, the other firm had provided an unasked-for option to train management in the skills required as a result of the employee feedback that was gathered. I could have done the same, but it wasn’t requested so I didn’t offer it. The other firm did, with an added fee, and got the business. I don’t have to learn those lessons twice.

Get out of the boxes that are inadvertently established for you. Don’t feel constrained by prospect requests, RFPs or pages of specifications. The value-added we all can bring is not a result of slavish adherence to demands, but rather of innovative options to otherwise mundane requests.

Short Lesson: Compliance is never innovative, and value is based on raising the bar, not restoring it to its prior height.
Shortcut of the month: If you want to get references from large, recognizable organizations, but don’t have any as clients, try this. Offer to speak at a Rotary, Kiwanis, Chamber of Commerce or some other service club always seeking speakers. When people tell you later that they liked your comments, get their business card. You’ll find some from major organizations. Simply contact them and ask if they’d care to put their comments in writing (which will be on their letterhead), in return for which you’ll send them a written copy of your speech. Bingo, you’ll have testimonial letters from major sources.

A great many people ask me how to make the transition from an hourly or per diem fee arrangement to a project/value-based basis. There is no easy way, once you’ve educated the buyer about the wrong way to do business with you. But there is a technique I’ve recommended that mentorees are telling me has worked well for them.

Submit your proposal to the long-time client in the traditional manner, citing whatever your billing practice has been (i.e., $3,500 per seminar, $2,500 per day, $250 per person trained, etc.). Then suggest an option to your client. Explain that, in view of your excellent relationship, you’d like to provide an alternative whereby the client does not have to make an investment decision every time your assistance is considered. Therefore, you’re suggesting a monthly (or quarterly or semi-annual or yearly) retainer, which provides unlimited access to you for that period, irrespective of number of days, number of hours, number of participants, etc.

Make it an attractive option. If the client would reasonable be considering using you for a minimum of two days a month for at least a quarter at a per diem rate of $3,500, for example, then make the retainer $30,000 for the quarter. At a slight increase of the original expenditure ($21,000) the client can use as much of your talent as necessary.

Before you press the panic (or the e-mail) button and tell me that you can’t control use of your time this way, let me advise you of a few conditions to guarantee success with this arrangement:

Detail in the proposal that the time required for the quarter is on request but subject to mutually-agreed upon dates. That allows you to continue to schedule your time proactively.
Stipulate that the retainer is monthly but payable for 90 days at a time at the beginning of the quarter (the minimum period). This allows you to collect your money and use it, and prevents the engagement from being cancelled. Allow an option for the client to continue the arrangement through the next quarter if it is requested by the beginning of the final month in the current quarter. (In other words, you want to create seamless continuation, not renegotiation with the danger of a month or so falling “into the crack.”)
Finally—and listen to me on this one—stop worrying. No client I’ve ever worked with abuses such as system, just as no executive is overwhelmed with visitors when he or she announces an “open door policy.” Your clients will use discretion. (In most cases, I actually have to remind them about their access because they’re not using me enough, which also adds value to our relationship.) It helps, of course, to use fees high enough that the margins are so great that it doesn’t matter at all if a client uses three days or twelve, wants 25 participants trained or 95, calls you twice a month or once a day. Don’t be timid. You can always revert to your old, commodity, fee structure. But you’ll never create wealth that way. If the buyer says, “Why are you offering an alternative fee basis? We’ve worked on a comfortable basis for quite a while now,” respond, “I felt I wasn’t taking your best interests into mind sufficiently. There should never be a meter running in our relationship, and I don’t want you to make an investment decision every time I can be of help. Conversely, I don’t want to force one on you when I see areas which require further study.” Make sure your objectives are crystal-clear for the project. That way your time won’t be abused by “scope creep,” meaning that you’re asked to contribute to everything from marketing to window washing as long as you’re on retainer. Clear objectives provide a template that you can use to demonstrate that a request in inside or outside the current project scope.
