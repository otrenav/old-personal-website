# 1. Failing to pay attention to corporate formalities

- Formation
- Stock issuance
- Founder agreements
- Give corporate and legal matters the same respect as engineering
- Bonus: incorporate early enough

# 2. Complicating the formation process

- KISS
- Where to incorporate
- Choice of entity (Corporation vs LLC)
- S Corp vs C Corp

# 3. Failing to appropriately address founder equity

- Subject founders' stock vesting
- Founders' departure triggers repurchase of some share by company
- 83(b) election are critical
- Transfer restrictions - ROFR and IPO lock-up

# 4. Dwelling on valuation

- Focus on winning before worrying about your share of the win
- A company never went out of business because of dilution

# 5. Failing to raise enough money (for fear of dilution or otherwise)

- Everything costs twice as much as you think it will
- Everything takestwice as long as you think it will
- Management needs to run the business rather than be preoccupied with
  fundraising efforts

# 6. Spending money too quickly

- Hire conservatively and purposefully (programmer vs CFO)
- Consider equity compensation (with vesting)

# 7. Failing to pick advisors who add value to your business

- Investors
- Directors
- Service providers and advisors

# 8. Failing to adequately protect your intellectual property assets

- Rights of former employers
- Rights of consultants and other third party developers
- Lack of adequate trade secret protection (NDAs)
- Secure IP assets (restrict access, etc)
