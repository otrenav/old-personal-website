12 KPIs you must know before pitching your startup
By Phil Nadel, techcrunch.comView Original

It is critically important for the founders of a company to intimately understand the company’s key performance indicators (KPIs). Founders cannot hope to grow a company in any meaningful way without an almost obsessive focus on its KPIs.

Why? Because KPIs, if constructed correctly, give management and potential investors a cold, analytical snapshot of the state of the company, untainted by emotion or rhetoric. This focus must not be limited to the KPIs themselves, for they are merely measurements of outcomes. We look for founders to have an understanding of what levers can be pulled and what tweaks can be made to improve the business, which will then be reflected in its KPIs.

The focus should not be on the KPIs themselves, but the meaning behind them and knowing what impacts each one.

Let’s review some of the KPIs that are important for founders to thoroughly understand and for which they should have a strategy, or set of strategies, for optimizing. Please note that some KPIs are not relevant to some types of businesses. Finally, I am not going to go into very much detail on each metric and how to calculate it as (a) that is beyond the scope of this article, and (b) that information is readily available from other sources.

Customer acquisition cost (CAC). CAC is the amount of money you need to spend on sales, marketing and related expenses, on average, to acquire a new customer. This tells us about the efficiency of your marketing efforts, although it’s much more meaningful when combined with some of the other metrics below, and when compared to competitors’ CAC.

Acquiring new customers is one thing, but retaining them is even more important. Your customer retention rate indicates the percentage of paying customers who remain paying customers during a given period of time. The converse to retention rate is churn (or attrition), the percentage of customers you lose in a given period of time. When we see high retention rates over an indicative time period, we know the company has a sticky product and that it is keeping its customers happy. This is also an indicator of capital efficiency.

Lifetime value (LTV) is the measurement of the net value of an average customer to your business over the estimated life of the relationship with your company. Understanding this number, especially in its relation to CAC, is critical to building a sustainable company.

We consider the ratio of CAC to LTV to be the golden metric. This is a true indicator of the sustainability of a company. If a company can predictably and repeatedly turn x into 10x (note: 10x is just an illustration and not meant to imply any sort of minimum or standard), then it’s sustainable.


			The most successful founders tend to be those who have an obsessive focus on their KPIs and the drive to constantly experiment and optimize them.
CAC recovery time (or months to recover CAC). This KPI measures how long it takes for a customer to generate enough net revenue to cover the CAC. CAC recovery time has a direct impact on cash flow and, consequentially, runway.

Whereas CAC measures the variable expenses attributable to acquiring customers, overhead measures the company’s fixed expenses incurred irrespective of the number of customers acquired. Overhead relative to revenue is a reflection of the capital efficiency of a company (i.e. all things being equal, a company that generates $1 million in revenue on $200,000 in overhead is twice as efficient as one that generates $1 million in revenue on $400,000 in overhead).

Understanding your revenue and monthly expenses (fixed and variable) enables you to calculate the company’s monthly burn. This is simply the net amount of cash flow for a month when net cash flow is negative. If the company starts the month with $100,000 in cash and ends the month with $90,000 in cash, its burn rate is $10,000. If a company’s monthly net cash flow is positive, it is not burning cash.

A keen focus on runway is critical to the survival of any startup. Runway is the measure of the amount of time until the company runs out of cash, expressed in terms of months. Runway is computed by dividing remaining cash by monthly burn. We prefer to view a conservative estimate of runway that calculates the monthly burn utilizing current revenue and projected expenses (after accounting for the increased expenses to be incurred post-investment). We require an absolute minimum of 12 months of runway, but have a strong preference for 18 months or more. Short runways cause entrepreneurs to by myopic and not to have the liberty to tweak and iterate when necessary. It also forces them to almost immediately focus on the next fundraising round instead of growing the company.

Expressed as a percentage, profit margin tells us how much your product sells for above the actual cost of the product itself. Put another way, it reveals how much of the selling price is “mark-up.” This invaluable metric allows us to consider the return on investment on the cost of the product and is significant in understanding the scalability and sustainability of the company.

We consider conversion rate to be a very telling KPI in that it reveals a combination of the company’s ability to sell its products to its customers and customers’ desire for the product. It is particularly instructive to track and review conversion rate over time and regularly run experiments to improve it.

Certain businesses find that revenue may not be the most informative indicator of their financial performance. This is especially true for marketplaces for which revenue (i.e. their take rate) represents a small portion of overall transactions. Gross merchandise volume (GMV) can be a useful KPI in these cases. GMV is the overall dollar value of sales of goods or services purchased through a marketplace.

For companies that have apps, online games or social networking sites, monthly active users (MAU) is an important KPI. MAU is the number of unique users who engage with the site or app in a 30-day period. Understanding MAU is helpful in determining the revenue potential of a company or how well it is currently monetizing.

When we speak to founders to learn more about their companies, we ask them for these KPIs, along with their narrative and other information. It is a quick way for us to understand the current state of the business and we have serious concerns about founders who do not know their KPIs.  We find that the most successful founders tend to be those who have an obsessive focus on their KPIs and the drive to constantly experiment and optimize them.

21 Most Important SaaS Startup Metrics
By Tom Gorski, www.saasgenius.comView OriginalAugust 24th, 2016
I’m sure you know how important it is to track progress. Or the benefits of measuring metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) to grow and build the business. But are you sure you’re tracking the right ones though? You see:

Traffic growth, for instance could paint a pretty picture. So couldthe growing subscriber rate, for instance. But couple these with a rising cost of acquisition and the picture suddenly turns grim. That’s why, it’s imperative that you monitor the right metrics, depending on your business objectives.


And in this post I’ll show you 21 metrics I think every SaaS startup should track, divided into 3 categories:

Metrics for Fundraising,
Metrics for Growth, and
Acquisition Metrics.
So, without any further ado…

Part 1: Metrics to Use for Fundraising
It’s no secret, fundraising is a hectic time for any startup. Investor requests come day and night, one more challenging than the other.

1. Monthly Recurring Revenue
Let’s be honest:

You’re not spending every waking moment at work for any other reason than to build a sustainable business. And it’s a challenging task.

For one, you have to grow fast enough to offset investment with monthly subscriptions as quickly as possible. And Monthly Recurring Revenue helps establish what revenue you could expect to receive each month. And, according to SaaSoptics, that’s the most important SaaS metrics of all.

MRR typically includes:

Recurring plans,
Recurring add-ons,
Any discounts you’ve offered to recurring charges,
It however does not include:

Setup fees,
Once-off add-ons,
Non-recurring fees,
Credit adjustments.
2. Cost of Acquisition (CAC)
FACT: acquisition is one the biggest expenses for SaaS companies.

Targeting wrong marketing channels or make the onboarding process to cumbersome to customers could result in high CAC and huge losses for the business. And the only way to find out is by tracking how much it actually costs you to gain each paid customer. You can calculate CAC by adding up all your monthly marketing and sales related expenses. And then dividing that number by the number of new customers.

3. Lifetime Customer Value
LCV is value of customer relationship measured in cash. The metric helps determine how much revenue you could expect per customer during the entire future relationship with them. Knowing the value could help you establish how much money you could spend to acquire a customer.

For instance: If your LCV = $30 and profit margin you strive for is 30%, then for a customer to be profitable the CAC should not exceed $21.

4. Churn Rate
SaaS is all about retaining customers. The role of many departments, sales and marketing included is not just to attract but also keep customers for as long as possible.

Yet there will always be users cancelling the service. Some might be unhappy with your app. Others have lost the interest in using it.

And churn rate is a metric that focuses on the number of unsubscribes each month.

Churn rate could reveal a lot about your business. A high churn rate always signals a problem. It could mean that users don’t find your product helpful. Or it’s too complex for them to use.

Faced with higher than usual churn rate, you should focus all energy into solving the problem, rather than acquiring new users.

5. Burn Rate
Just like churn rate measures the decrease in users, burn rate tracks cash. Burn rate indicates how much money your company is either spending (also known as gross burn rate) or losing (the net burn rate) each month. In investor terms, it indicates how quickly you’re going to, nomen omen, burn their cash at your current rate.

Here’s a quick example:

With monthly costs at $300000 and $180000 MRR, your monthly net burn rate = $120000. With a million in the bank, and assuming your burn rate won’t change, you have only 8 months before the cash runs out.

Part 2: Metrics for Growth
Whether you’re currently seeing investors or not, growth is still your primary concern. The metrics below help measure your progress, spot any potential problems and identify what aspects of your business you should improve first.

6. Average Revenue per Customer
A very straightforward metric that tracks the average revenue you have already received per customer.

7. Total Contract Value
TCV is the full value of an average customer contract with the company. The difference between TCV and MRR for instance is that it includes the entire revenue per customers, incl. one-time charges, fees, upsells etc.

8. Annual Contract Value
ACV indicates the value of an average contract over a 12-month period. Just like TCV, it should include additional purchases, fees and upsells to give a complete overview of your contracts. The most important thing to look at ACV is growth or shrinking trend over time. If your ACV is growing, it means customers are paying you more.

9. Number of Active Users
As its name suggests, AU tracks the number of people who are actively using your product. When tracking it, be clear about who you define as an active user though. Is it someone who logs in only once a week or a more frequent user? Specifying it will help avoid catching first time users and new customers in the number.

10. Number of Registered Users
This metric tracks the total number of people who have signed up for your app. When monitoring it, specify how deep into registrations do you want to go - include trial users as well. Or only paying customers. Coupled with the number of active users, this metric could help you establish your app’s adoption rate.

11. Month on Month (MoM) Growth
This metric is often measured as the combination of the average growth rates with respect to the previous month. When measuring MoM, pay attention to one-time events that can cause data spikes on a given month. Year on year seasonality also plays a significant role in shaping the MoM data (as in, your growth might be slower on certain months, summer for instance, each year).

12. Total Revenue / Turnover
Turnover measures the total number of sales of a particular package for a specific period of time. The simplest method to calculate is by multiplying price per unit by the number of units sold. For a SaaS product it would be the number of paying customers by package price they pay. You can then sum up revenue per package to receive the total revenue.

13. Gross Profit
Gross Profit outlines the profitability of a specific income stream and includes all costs associated with production, marketing and support. Gross profit is defined in dollar values.

14. Gross Margin
Defined as the total revenue minus the cost of goods sold, Gross Margin reveals how much money you have to cover your operating expenses. The difference between Gross Profit and Gross Margin is that the former deals with actual dollar amounts. The latter however is calculated as a percentage value.

15. Product Usage / Engagement
A useful metric that could potential problems with product adoption resulting in lower customer satisfaction and higher churn.

Tracking PU means observing certain customer actions, as:

Frequency of logins to the app,
Session length,
Most common functionality they use (and what they haven’t even set up), and
Gaps between each session.
Based on patterns in these interactions you could identify potential adoption problems. Fixing those in turn could help reduce churn rate, improve customer satisfaction and positively affect your word of mouth.

16. Net Promoter Score
First introduced in 2003, this is the most popular metric to gauge customer satisfaction and loyalty. NPS focuses on the likelihood of a person to recommend the company or its product to their friends / family / connections. NPS typically uses the Likert scale (0-10 with 0 meaning unlikely and 10 = definitely likely).

Based on NPS you can identify the % of promoters (people definitely likely to recommend you) and detractors (people unlikely or highly unlikely to recommend you. Typically, these are all respondents who ranked 6 or below on the Likert scale). Naturally, the higher your score the better. It indicates satisfied users, one who are likely to stay with you over time.

Part 3: Acquisition
Customer acquisition is the lifeblood of any SaaS. After all, the more potential users you attract, the greater your chance at converting them into paying customers. And growing your user base.

Here are a couple of metrics you should monitor to assess the acquisition strategies.

17. Total Addressable Market
A helpful metric for when you’re trying to assess the potential of a market you want to pursue. TAM helps to address the revenue opportunity available for a particular product or a service. One way to calculate it is to estimate how much market you could gain if there were no competitors. Another, by calculating the size of a market one specific company could service given realistic expansion scenario.

In short, TAM indicates how big your venture could really get, potentially.

18. Sources of Traffic
I agree, this is a multilayered metric revealing a lot about your marketing and acquisition strategies.

First, it suggests if your traffic is divided equally (or proportionally) between all channels you’re targeting. It helps spot the “platform risk” when one channel begins to dominate your marketing, putting your marketing efforts in jeopardy. For instance: reliance on PPC could lead to a significant increase in cost of acquisition as bids per click in this business model continue to rise.

Too strong reliance on organic traffic might on the other hand result in a loss of greater number of new visitors if a new Google update targets your site.

19. Website New vs. Return Visitors
New visitors indicate fresh visitors who potentially haven’t seen your site before (give or take of course, due to some technical limitations with tracking visits). Return visitors however suggest that someone has liked your site. And even though he or she hasn’t converted yet, the sheer act of coming back suggests they’re considering doing so. Put together however, the two metrics could reveal a lot about your site and inbound strategies. Having only new visitors might indicate that:

Your attracting irrelevant visitors, or
Even if they’re relevant, these people don’t find your app (or website) engaging enough to come back.
Receiving only return visits however suggests problems with new visitor attraction (poor ranking, bidding on irrelevant keywords and so on).

20. Number of New Trial Signups (or Free Accounts)
You should also consider monitoring the overall number of signups (be it to free account or trials). It helps to establish your visitor to signup conversion rate. And in turn, confirm the quality of your inbound traffic.

21. Free to Paying Customers Conversion Rate
Similarly, you should monitor the conversion rate from free / trial users to paying customers. It could help reveal the quality of your onboarding process, for instance. Or, coupled with the app usage, signal adoption problems.

There is a number of techniques to use to increase free to paid conversions:

Structuring the free plan to entice conversions,
Limiting features,
Showing the full scope of the product,
Sending emails with usage tips, or
Forwarding active trial users to sales.
And, that’s it..
FACT:

Nothing should be more important to SaaS owner than the right metrics.

There’s a whole lot of insight behind those numbers. And all it really takes is pick the right metrics, depending to your current business objectives, add them to custom dashboard and… start using them to grow the company.
