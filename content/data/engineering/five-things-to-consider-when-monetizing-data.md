5 Things to Think About When Considering Monetizing Data

 Harnessing the power of data-driven insights continues to top the wish list for many executives seeking to build a competitive advantage. Does your brand have the mindset, resources and

Marketers aren’t alone in recognizing the value of data. If, as has been widely asserted, data has taken the place of oil as the most significant untapped global asset, then it’s no wonder brands today are increasingly seeking ways to monetize this ever-expanding asset. The objective may be clear, but the path to get there is less obvious. For those thinking about data monetization, there are five critical factors to consider when determining whether your business is ready.

1. Does your company value data as an asset on the balance sheet?

While current accounting practice doesn’t recognize data as an asset, in recent years some companies have begun using asset valuation methodologies for applying a value to the information they collect and manage. Doing so can help brands set expectations, assess governance approaches and determine the strategic importance of this data. Appropriately prioritizing management decisions around the capture, use and applications of various data segments has led to fundamental changes within these emerging data-centric organizations. In fact, how data is managed and applied to business objectives at a tactical level increasingly differentiates how an organization performs at a strategic level.

Today, those in the C-suite who “get it” increasingly speak to the value of customer data, understand the benefit of omnichannel identity resolution to enhance customer engagement, and allocate additional resources and budget to capture data from new sources. These executives are likely asking themselves and their colleagues a number of tough questions:

Is the company weighing investment in data capture, collection, curation and insight generation across its portfolio against return on this investment?
Can incremental sales be tied to improved insights generated as a result of effective data curation?
Can the CMO create ongoing conversations with customers across online and offline platforms?
If not, data monetization can accelerate these capabilities when applied thoughtfully and in a privacy-compliant manner.

2. How much does your company spend annually to manage and capture data?

If your organization has identified data monetization as a potential new revenue source, then it should determine the current annual investment in capturing and managing existing data. In partnership with the financial arm of your organization, there should be an annual review of data sources. If this information isn’t being used internally and isn’t required to be kept for legal purposes, then the expense of capturing and keeping it may be unwarranted.

Regular data pruning—which includes understanding what data is currently captured, the cost to manage it and the benefits of associated insights—is a necessary and worthwhile practice. It’s also a foundational step in monetizing data.

3. Does the company easily process raw customer data into action-oriented insights?

Can your company easily identify a customer that calls into a company location for help, and can you reconcile this customer’s identity with his online behavior? Does the marketing department leverage data connected to sales when building campaigns? If not, data monetization could be a needed catalyst to create a data-driven mindset and create a new revenue stream to help fund change within a budget-constrained organization. As a result, marketing organizations can begin to prioritize messages to consumers based on informed and highly accurate data-driven insights.

4. Does the company comfortably discuss data across divisional silos?

Data has an unfortunate tendency to exist in silos. Few companies excel at sharing data across the organization for the benefit of the customer and the entire enterprise . Often times, organizational structure, budget constraints or a host of other barriers prevent data and insights being leveraged broadly and holistically, to the detriment of business outcomes. Data monetization, however, can help reduce departmental conflict over insights while also enabling a new revenue stream that has potential to improve profitability for the entire operation.

5. Does your company consider data in its strategic planning?

Data enablement within an organization should become an integral part of near-term and longer-term strategic planning. At the most basic level, these plans should project and track expenses, cost savings and sales tied to internal data usage. Subsequently, external use cases for data—and options for how to monetize data assets—should also be considered. When contemplating data monetization, it’s imperative to consider 1) your current privacy policy, 2) the uniqueness of your data, 3) the scale of your data, and 4) whether there is demand for your data.

The digital world is all about disrupting traditional business models. Companies that have led industries for decades are now faced with new competitors that don’t have the same cost structure and can move more expeditiously to serve customers.

In response to the shifting business landscape, countless traditional companies—many of which have captured data for years—have realized customer data and its appropriate use can unlock pent-up potential in their organization. Brands that tap the value of their data can use it to their advantage, competing at scale with digital disrupters and meeting customers’ growing expectations for brand engagement.

Companies willing to evolve their approach to data can move toward becoming a data-driven enterprise, with data monetization serving as the catalyst to propel progress.
