Here are 5 questions to answer if you are thinking about hiring a
data scientist. It depends not only on a person, but on the company
culture, business problem and understanding its potential.

The hype around big data has caused many organisations to hire
data scientists without giving much thought to what these data
scientists are going to do and whether they’re actually needed. This
is a source of frustration for all parties involved. This post discusses

5 questions you should ask yourself before deciding to hire your
first data scientist.
Q1: Do you know what data scientists do?
Somewhat surprisingly, there are quite a few companies that hire
data scientists without having a clear idea of what data scientists
actually do. People seem to have a fear of missing out on the big
data hype, and think of hiring data scientists as the solution. A
common misconception is that a data scientist’s role includes telling
you what to do with your data. While this may sometimes happen in
practice, the ideal scenario is where the business has problems
that can be solved using data science (more on this under Q3
below). If you don’t know what your data scientist is going to do,
you probably don’t need one.
So what do data scientists do? When you think about it, adding the
word “data” to “science” is a bit redundant, as all science is based
on data. Following from this, anyone who does any kind of data
analysis is a data scientist. While it may be true, this broad
definition is not very helpful. As discussed in a previous post, it’s
more useful to define data scientists as individuals who combine
expertise in statistics and machine learning with strong software
engineering skills.
Q2: Do you have enough data available?

It’s not uncommon to see products that suffer from
over-engineering and premature investment in advanced analytics
capabilities. In the early stages, it’s important to focus on creating a
minimum viable product and getting it to market quickly. Data
science starts to shine once the product is generating enough data,
as most of the power of advanced analytics is in optimising and
automating existing processes.
Not having a data scientist in the early stages doesn’t mean the
data is being ignored – it just means that it doesn’t require the
attention of a full-time data scientist. If your product is at an early
stage and you are still concerned, you’re better off hiring a data
science consultant for a few days to help lay out the long-term
vision for data-driven capabilities. This would be cheaper and less
time-consuming than hiring a full-timer. The exception to this rule is
when the product itself is built around advanced analytics (e.g.,
AlchemyAPI or Enlitic). Building such products without data
scientists is far from ideal, or just impossible.
Even if your product is mature and generating a lot of data, it
doesn’t mean it’s ready for data science. Advanced analytics
capabilities are at the top of data’s hierarchy of needs: If your
product is buggy, or if your data is scattered everywhere and your
platform lacks centralized reporting, you need to first invest in fixing
your data plumbing. This is the job of data engineers. Getting data
scientists involved when the data is hardly available due to
infrastructure issues is likely to lead to frustration. In addition,

setting up centralized reporting and dashboards is likely to give you
ideas for problems that data scientists can solve.
Q3: Do you have a specific problem to solve?
If the problem you’re trying to solve is “everyone is doing smart
things with data, we should be doing stuff with data too”, you don’t
have a specific problem that can be solved by bringing a data
scientist on board. Defining the problem often ends up occupying a
lot of the data scientist’s time, so you are likely to obtain better
results if have more than just a vague idea around “doing
something with data, because Hadoop”. Ideally you want to
optimise an existing process that is currently being solved with
heuristics, make an existing model better, implement a new
data-driven feature, or something along these lines. Common
examples include reducing churn, increasing conversions, and
replacing manual processes with automated data-driven systems.
Again, getting advice from experienced data scientists before
committing to hiring one may be your best first step.
Q4: Can you get away with heuristics, intuition, and/or manual
processes?
Some data scientists would passionately claim that you must
deploy only models that are theoretically justified and well-tested.
However, in many cases you can get away with using simple
heuristics, intuition, and/or manual processes. These can be orders

of magnitude cheaper than building sophisticated predictive models
and the infrastructure to support them. For many businesses, there
are more pressing needs than doing everything in a theoretically
sound way. Despite what many technical people like to think,
customers don’t tend to care how things are implemented, as long
as their needs are fulfilled.
For example, I spent some time with a client whose product
includes a semi-manual part where structured data is extracted
from documents. Their process included sending some of the
documents to a trained team in the Philippines for manual analysis.
The client was interested in replacing that manual work with a
machine learning algorithm. As is often the case with machine
learning, it was unknown whether the resultant model would be
accurate enough to completely replace the manual workers. This
generally depends on data quality and the feasibility of solving the
problem. Assessing the feasibility would have taken some time and
money, so the client decided to park the idea and focus on other
areas of their business.
Every business has resource constraints. Situations where the best
investment you can make is hiring a full-time data scientist are rarer
than what the hype may make you think. It’s often the case that
functions that would be the responsibility of a data scientist are
adequately performed by existing employees, such as software
engineers, business/data analysts, and marketers.

Q5: Are you committed to being data-driven?
I have seen more than one case where data scientists are hired
only to be blocked or ignored. This is more prevalent in the
corporate world, where managers are often incentivised to prioritise
doing things that look good over things that make financial sense.
But even if recruitment is done with the best intentions, progress
may be blocked by employees who feel threatened because they
would be replaced by automated data-driven algorithms.
Successful data science projects require support from senior
leadership, as discussed by Greta Roberts, Radim Rehurek, Alec
Smith, and many others. Without such support and a strong
commitment to making data-driven decisions, everyone is just
wasting their time.
Closing thoughts
While data science is currently over-hyped, many organisations still
have much to gain from hiring data scientists. I hope that this post
has helped you decide whether you need a data scientist right now.
If you’re unsure, please don’t hesitate to contact me. And to any
data scientists reading this: Be very wary of potential employers
who do not have good answers to the above questions. At this point
in time you can afford to be picky, at least until the hype is over.
