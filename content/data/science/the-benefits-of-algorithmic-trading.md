So, what are the benefits of algorithmic trading then?

Liquidity
Studies reveal that more algorithmic traders in a marketplace smooth inefficiencies, narrows spreads, and improves order book depth. In the crypto market especially, algorithmic trading will make trading cheaper, easier, and more accessible for all traders, not only those deploying bots.

Costs
When and how you enter the market, especially if you are placing large trades, can make a big difference in your execution price. Algorithms can help determine when it’s most cost-effective to enter the market, saving you money.

Speed
If you want to buy or sell at a particular price, it’s much faster for a computer to automatically enter a market or limit order than to do it manually. This is crucial when crypto is prone to large movements based on breaking news and events.

Accuracy
It’s easy for human beings to make mistakes when placing orders — much less so for computers. Not only can algorithmic trading ensure your strategy is executed to its full potential, but more sophisticated strategies can typically only be implemented via algorithm.

Backtesting
If you have a strategy in mind, you can test it against old data to determine its profitability. This means you can safely play with parameters until you come up with a winning formula.

Time
If you’re running an algorithm, you don’t have to stay glued to your screen. You can program your strategy, let it run, and spend that time researching even better approaches. Plus, you can even trade while you sleep!

Discipline
Anyone can get caught up in the highs and lows of trading, even the best fund managers. It’s difficult for your emotions to override logic when you’re following computerized rules.
