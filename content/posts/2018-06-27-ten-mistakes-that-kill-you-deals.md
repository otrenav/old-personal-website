# 1. Not selling the solution

- "If I could magically solve two or three recurring issues for you with this,
  what would they be?"

People close when they are hopefully confident their problems can be solved.

# 2. Missing buying signals

Have a great presentation prepared but pay attention to what is important: the
signs from everyone in the room that is a decision maker or influencer. Ask a
lot of questions and get involvement, and always look for opportunities to close
early.

# 3. Refuse to ask hard questions

- "How do you feel about our pricing?"
- "How do you feel about our terms?"
- "Why would you do business with me when you have done it with our competition
  for so long?"

Make sure you get answers to hard questions, it's the only way to improve.

# 4. Believing price will solve problems

No one buys a price, ever.

# 5. Presenting without the intention to close

- "Thanks for yuor time today, my goal is to have my product to your company by
  the end of this week." Response: "We have no intention of doing anything that
  quickly". Then reply: "I understand. I just wanted you to know my intention."

You must present with confidence, not with arrogance, and set the stage early
showing that you know your product can solve their problems.

# 6. Not asking for the close early enough

- "Have you seen enough information to make a decision?"

# 7. Price mystery

- "Before I demonstrate our product ability to solve your problems, I want to
  show you our pricing so you can think with it." They may reply: "that is too
  high", and you may respond: "Of course it seems high, you haven't seen what it
  will do. Allow me to sho you why it's priced this way and what it will do for
  you and why it's the best value in the market."

Saving price for later is a rookie closers mistake.

# 8. Ignoring influencers

- "Who else, other than yourself, will influence your decision?"
- "Who else would you like involved?"

Ask the influencers: "What problem are you most interested in solving?"

Don't ignore anyone, they will kill your deal.

# 9. Using a free trial to close a deal

Free trial will result in you investing more time.
Free trials create cash flow problems for your company.

# 10. No urgency

Anything can happen when you add time to the equation.
Learning how to pressure is an art.
