Requirements

- Service contracts
- Exposing new and existing services
- Discovery of services
- Coordination across services
- Managing complex deployments and their scalability
- Visibility and correlation across services

Ideas

- Culture of automation
- Hide implementation details
- Decentralize all the things
- Deploy independently
- Consumer first
- Isolate failure
- Highly observable
- Modelled around business domain

Principles

- Very, very small
- Loosely coupled (including flow)
- Multiple versions acceptable (encouraged?)
- Self-execution monitoring of each service
- Publish interesting "stuff" (w/o requirement)
- "Application" seems to be poor conceptualization
