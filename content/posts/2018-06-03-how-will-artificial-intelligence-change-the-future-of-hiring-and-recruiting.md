How Will Artificial Intelligence Change The Future Of Hiring And Recruiting?

Artificial intelligence is, by all accounts, here to stay. It is making serious inroads in 2018 and is coming to a business near you in the near future. With revenues from AI expected to reach $59.8 billion by 2025, according to a report by Tractica, this task-reducing technology can and will make your work responsibilities easier.

One of the ways that AI is expected to reduce the workload for employees is by making the mundane tasks of hiring and recruiting easier. Because the technology can automate many of the responsibilities that are time consuming and arduous for workers, AI is expected to be a faster and more efficient alternative for companies to employ as a part of their HR efforts.

Fourteen members of Forbes Coaches Council share how they expect AI to change the hiring and recruiting practices in the near future, whether by making the overall process faster and more efficient, by reducing bias or by shifting the traditional role and duties of hiring managers.


Members of Forbes Coaches Council share their insight.
1. Hire Faster And Smarter

Bots will be able to scan and identify the top resumes in a batch of applicants, scheduling will be an automated process and natural language processing will allow for a more responsive candidate experience. Behavioral and situational interview assessments will leverage AI and predictive analytics to capture both quantitative and qualitative data to ensure the right match. - Leanne Wong, MC Partners

2. Offer More Time For What Matters

AI technologies will continue to alter and streamline the way people apply for jobs and get hired, fast-tracking resume screening, reducing human bias, and creating efficiencies. Ultimately, these process improvements will enable recruiters more time to focus on the human side of things — because human connections are, and will always be, a critical component to retaining top employees. - Adrienne Tom, Career Impressions

3. Allow For More Thoughtful Recruiting

Humans only have so much time and bandwidth, and AI is already filling that gap effectively in a way we’ve never seen. Systems like Mya can interview and follow up with candidates, meaning we have unprecedented communication channels in the hiring process that simply couldn’t exist previously. Combine that with advances in keyword matching and perception, and it’s a fine-tuned recruiting system. - Laura DeCarlo, Career Directors International

4. Minimize Hiring Bias

AI should be seen as a hiring tool and not a threat. In 2018, I believe we will see more intangibles/soft skills being assessed along with a psychological profile using some form of AI as a screen. The caveat here is the algorithms being developed for this new tool need to be fair and ethical. Put another way, hiring bias (e.g., gender, race, age) can be minimized using AI. - Randy Block, Randy Block

5. Improve Efficiency And Experience

More companies will use AI to scan resumes, schedule interviews, and send routine emails, which improves efficiency for companies and candidates. It will improve the candidate experience by making early interactions more personalized, thus laying the foundation for genuine and relevant interviews as the hiring process proceeds. AI can enable real relationships between companies and candidates. - Kelly Byrnes, Voyage Consulting Group


6. Enable Greater Humanity In The Practice

AI will show us how to bring humanity back to the center of hiring and recruiting practices. Simply put, AI holds the unique ability to teach humans how to be more human. AI can enhance our practices in efficiency, consistency, and scalability, to name a few. However, AI’s brilliance and skill will also open the doors for us to return to our deepest core brilliance — authentic human connection. - Tonyalynne Wildhaber, The Courage Practice

7. Offer More Complete Profiling

AI may be able to tell us more about our future employees — where they have the most energy, how they thrive and how they will struggle with complete profiling. I have seen firsthand how different individuals with the same profile in these assessments function. We may be able to get a better idea of future employees, which hopefully will not account for personalized touch points. - Heather Pinay, Authentically: Business & Life Solutions

8. Perfect Searching And Outreach

AI’s next major boost to recruiting will come from more effective sourcing and outreach. Referrals will remain the No. 1 source of hire because of their data-backed effectiveness, but hiring beyond that requires sorting through thousands of potential candidates and reaching out in a personalized way to start a conversation. AI will be better at both. - Scott Swedberg, The Job Sauce

9. Find Better Fits

It’s important to see AI beyond categorization and simple matching of people and skills. Pairing job seekers to open positions is currently the most basic way AI is used. But algorithms that are routinely 80-90% accurate now will only continue to improve and be used to highlight relevant stories, assess fit, sense behavioral and personality traits, and provide self-awareness soft-skill tool kits. - Joanne Markow, GreenMason

10. Automate Interviews

With the advent of facial recognition software that is able to record and determine emotion from facial expressions, expect serious changes in screening interviews. Some companies already have an AI system to handle the initial screening process to include recorded video for first-round interviews. Expect this to become the norm! Prepare and practice your ability to interact virtually. - Erin Urban, UPPSolutions, LLC

11. Include Social Media Activity In Assessments

The robots will be looking for your faults, your missteps and your activity on social media platforms. It will inform hiring, and you need to watch out for it by ensuring your activity involves professional work, volunteerism and things that point to your fitness for the job. The bots will survey and scan you, and that will likely be a part of what you surrender when you apply to a new role. - John M. O’Connor, Career Pro Inc.

12. Clarify Expectations

I expect objective algorithms will clarify expectations. This will be a good thing, as it will save time, resources, and be impartial. However, with that in mind, people may manipulate the system to get desired positions. I believe we should never lose sight that we are human and that humans will be filling the positions. AI will simplify the process, but we need to complete it. - Frances McIntosh, Intentional Coaching LLC

13. Re-Imagine Talent Acquisition Jobs

AI will fundamentally change the role and responsibilities of talent acquisition professionals. About 65% of recruiting tasks such as resume screening and interviewing will be replaced by AI systems. As a result, the role will be re-imagined with a focus on interdisciplinary acumen aligned with business strategy and consultative relationship building with business and industry partners. – Dr. Terri Horton, TLT Consulting: Brand & Workforce Strategy

14. Help Recruit The Wrong People Faster

The promise for AI is huge. Hiring, however, is a practice done well by few. The automated resume filters we use for buzzwords, skills and experience do not work well. Hiring for behaviors is what creates the best fit and most successful employees. It will be some time before AI screens behaviors well. In most cases, humans don’t know which behaviors to tell AI to look for in an ideal candidate. - Jim Vaselopulos, Rafti Advisors, Inc.
