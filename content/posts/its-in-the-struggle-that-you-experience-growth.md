> There has never yet been a man in our history who led a life of ease whose
> name is worth remembering. Never in history has the easy life led to a great
> life. Not in one case has something great come without tribulation, struggle,
> or failure. Instead of fearing struggle, strain, and tribulation, you should
> embrace it; nay, seek it at every opportunity, and incorporate it into your
> life daily. It’s in struggle that you experience growth. It’s in conquering
> obstacles that you experience life.
