We’ve covered a few fundamentals and pitfalls of data
analytics in our past blog posts. In this blog post, we focus on the four types
of data analytics we encounter in data science: Descriptive, Diagnostic,
Predictive and Prescriptive.

When I talk to young analysts entering our world of data science, I often ask
them what they think is data scientist’s most important skill. Their answers
have been quite varied.

My message to them is that their most important skill will be their ability to
translate data into insights that are clear and meaningful to a non-quant. The
Swedish statistician Hans Rosling is famous for this. It’s an often overlooked
skill. The following TedTalk by Hans Rosling sheds some light:

On this theme, it would be worth unpacking some of the tools used to help
individuals understand the role of analytics in helping develop valuable
insights. One such tool is the 4-dimensional paradigm of analytics.

Simplistically, analytics can be divided into four key categories. I’ll explain
these four in more detail below.

1. Descriptive: What is happening?

This is the most common of all forms. In business it provides the analyst a view
of key metrics and measures within the business.

An examples of this could be a monthly profit and loss statement. Similarly, an
analyst could have data on a large population of customers. Understanding
demographic information on their customers (e.g. 30% of our customers are
self-employed) would be categorised as “descriptive analytics”. Utilising
effective visualisation tools enhances the message of descriptive analytics.

2. Diagnostic: Why is it happening?

This is the next step of complexity in data analytics is descriptive analytics.
On assessment of the descriptive data, diagnostic analytical tools will empower
an analyst to drill down and in so doing isolate the root-cause of a problem.

Well-designed business information (BI) dashboards incorporating reading of
time-series data (i.e. data over multiple successive points in time) and
featuring filters and drill down capability allow for such analysis.

3. Predictive: What is likely to happen?

Predictive analytics is all about forecasting. Whether it’s the likelihood of an
event happening in future, forecasting a quantifiable amount or estimating a
point in time at which something might happen – these are all done through
predictive models.

Predictive models typically utilise a variety of variable data to make the
prediction. The variability of the component data will have a relationship with
what it is likely to predict (e.g. the older a person, the more susceptible they
are to a heart-attack – we would say that age has a linear correlation with
heart-attack risk). These data are then compiled together into a score or
prediction.

In a world of great uncertainty, being able to predict allows one to make better
decisions. Predictive models are some of the most important utilised across a
number of fields.

Here are the Top Pitfalls to avoid in Predictive Analytics

4. Prescriptive: What do I need to do?

The next step up in terms of value and complexity is the prescriptive model. The
prescriptive model utilises an understanding of what has happened, why it has
happened and a variety of “what-might-happen” analysis to help the user
determine the best course of action to take. Prescriptive analysis is typically
not just with one individual action, but is in fact a host of other actions.

A good example of this is a traffic application helping you choose the best
route home and taking into account the distance of each route, the speed at
which one can travel on each road and, crucially, the current traffic
constraints.

Another example might be producing an exam time-table such that no students have
clashing schedules.

Conclusion While different forms of analytics may provide varying amounts of
value to a business, they all have their place. To find out how data analytics
