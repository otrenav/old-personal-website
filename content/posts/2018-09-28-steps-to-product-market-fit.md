- 9/10 products fail
- 2/3 drastically change their original plans

# Problem/solution fit

- Reasonable smart people can rationalize anything but entrepreneurs are
  especially gifted at this
  - Let the data speak
  - Be careful
- Business model (diagrama) vs Business plan (documento inútil)
- MVP Canvas (product vs market)
  - Product
    - Problem
    - Solution
    - Key metrics
    - Cost structure
  - Market
    - Unfair advantage
    - Channels
    - Customer segments
    - Revenue streams
  - In the middle: value proposition
- Vision > Strategy > Product
- Facebook won on strategy, not vision
- Hone in on early adopters first
- Your early adopters define the business model
- An MVP is the smallest solution that delivers value

# Early traction

- Startup down starve, they drown
- Financial accounting as well as innovation accounting
- Acquisition: how do users find you? (paid)
- Activation: do users have a great first experience?
- Retention: do users come back? (sticky)
- Revenue: how do you make money?
- Referral: how do users help you grow the network? (viral)
- Deliver value before growth
- The terrain before product/market fit is riddled with qualitative learning
- You do not need lots of users to learn. You only need a few good customers

# Product/market fit

- Identify your engine of growth
- "A startup can focus on only one metric. So you have to decide what that is
  and ignore the rest." —Noah Kagan
- "What is stopping your business from growing 10x?" —David Skok
- Metrics can tell you what's going on but not why
- Build a continuous feedback loop with customers for rapid hypothesis
  generation
- Breakthrough insights are ususally hidden within failed experiments
- A pivot not grounded in learning is a disguised "see what sticks" strategy
- Try to track users through the full funnel because independent time-series can
  have offsets that don't allow you to understand the necessary dynamics
  - Always use cohort analysis
