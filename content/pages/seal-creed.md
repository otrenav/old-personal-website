"[...] there is a special breed of warrior ready to answer our nation's call. A
common man with an uncommon desire to succeed. Forged by adversity, he stands
alongside America's finest... I am that man.

[...]

I serve with honor on and off the battlefield. The ability to control my
emotions and my actions, regardless of circumstance, sets me apart from other
men. Uncompromising integrity is my standard. My character and honor steadfast.
My word is my bond.

[...]

We demand discipline. We expect innovation. The livew of my teammates and the
success of our mission depend on me —my technical skill, tactical proficiency,
and attention to detail. My training is never complete.

[...]

Brave men have fought and died building the proud tradition and feared
reputation that I am bound to uphold. In the worst conditions, the legacy of my
teammates steadies my resolve and silently guides my every deed. I will not
fail. "
